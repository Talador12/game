**Installation Steps**

1. I included some of the installer files on our repo, just to ensure we all start with the same environment, under "Environment Setup"

2. With visual studio installed, simply open the Visual Studio Solution file on the repo to start the project located at:

	Game\Project\Game\Game.sln

3. Then we setup the libraries! Allegro 5.0 first.

Action RPG
Top down view (pokemon, zelda link to the past)
Seamless Transition
Cutscenes
Female Protagonist main character... who ends up realizing she is the antagonist in some way (writing TBD, we can work on it)
Physical Weapons (swords etc)
Magic
"Near Future" time, subtle magic infused (think korra episodes with spirits and trees everywhere)
We've discussed this being kind of a lost civilization that's the past, and the main character is somehow connected to all the shit that went down (maybe as the antagonist of the past? story TBD but we like this chain of thought)

We need to actually draft out a whole story sometime, since we want an immersive feel with the story, and between areas of the game (transition music challenge?)
